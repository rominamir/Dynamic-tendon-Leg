/home1/jiajinzh/.conda/envs/lab_render/lib/python3.9/site-packages/stable_baselines3/common/on_policy_algorithm.py:150: UserWarning: You are trying to run PPO on the GPU, but it is primarily intended to run on the CPU when not using a CNN policy (you are using ActorCriticPolicy which should be a MlpPolicy). See https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3/issues/1245 for more info. You can pass `device='cpu'` or `export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=` to force using the CPU.Note: The model will train, but the GPU utilization will be poor and the training might take longer than on CPU.

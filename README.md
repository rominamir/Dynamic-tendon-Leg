# Dynamic Tendon-Driven Robotic Leg

This project explores the design, simulation, and control of a **tendon driven robotic leg**. Inspired by biological muscle-tendon architectures, the system aims to advance understanding and implementation of **biomimetic actuation and impact of level of elasticity in learning** in legged robotics.

### Research Goals:
- Variable stiffness and damping via tendon control  
- Bio-inspired control of hopping or stance dynamics  
- Embedded sensing for proprioception and reflexes  
- Testing of model-based and learning-based controllers
